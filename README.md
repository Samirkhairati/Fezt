### CRUD Functionality
- **User Types**: There are two types of users: students and vendors.
- **Student Authentication**: Students can log in via Google OAuth, restricted to their BITS ID.
- **Vendor Authentication**: Vendors log in using their email and password.
- **Account Creation**: 
  - Email verification is required for both students and vendors. An email containing a verification code is sent, which must be entered to proceed with account creation.
  - Account creation involves completing forms with various fields, managed using react-hook-form and react-query.
- **Student Capabilities**:
  - Students can create, update, and delete clubs.
  - Clubs can create, update, and delete events.
  - Students can register for multiple events.
  - Students can place orders for multiple items sold by vendors.
- **Vendor Capabilities**:
  - Vendors can mark orders as accepted, ready, and delivered.

### Authentication
- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented for both students and vendors.
- **Google Sign-In**: Students sign in using their Google accounts via Firebase.
- **Email Services**: NodeMailer is used to send emails for confirmation, verification, and password recovery.

### Additional Features
- **Server-Side Caching**: Redis is used for caching to improve server performance.
- **Progressive Loading**: Events and items are progressively loaded as users scroll, enhancing user experience.
- **Dashboard**: Separate dashboards for students and vendors are created to manage clubs, events, items, and orders.

### Virtual Currency System
- **Initial Balance**: Each user starts with a balance of 12,000 virtual currency units.
- **Event Registration**: When students register for events, the event price is deducted from their account and added to the revenue of the club organizing the event.
- **Purchasing Items**: When students buy items, the virtual currency is transferred to the vendor's account.
- **Revenue Management**: Club revenues are displayed in a tabular format, showing the income from event registrations. 

This setup ensures an efficient and user-friendly system for managing campus activities and transactions.
